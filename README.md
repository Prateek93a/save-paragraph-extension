# save-paragraph-extension
chrome extension to save highlighted text along with the link to the page.

Basically this extension allows the users to save the highlighted certain text on a page, when user highlights the text and click on
the extension icon, the text appears in the popup, and user has option to save it. User can view previously saved texts as well.
I created this extension because I wanted to save certain points or paragraphs from different tutorials and docs since I didnot want 
to bookmark every page for just one paragraph and also I found saving the paragraphs on text documents along with the links to be cumbersome.
Hence I came up with this silly idea. Its UI can be improved a lot. And maybe one can extend it to have more features.
